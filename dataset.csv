"As far as full experience hibachi spots Wasabi does a good job putting on the show for the little ones. Our chef was a funny guy, making sure he joked around with everyone at the table.

Their style of hibachi, with carrots and broccoli, isn’t my favorite since their texture throws things off for me but the filet was cooked very well.

"I was out working and saw a sign that advertised a ""Thanksgiving burger."" I decided I'd like to stop by later on my way home and give it a try.  So I stopped in a few hours later and asked about the advertised burger. A burger with a deep fried turkey and stuffing patty, Swiss cheese, and cranberry aoli. I have to admit I was a little skeptical about the cranberry aoili, but I gave it a try. It's delicious and absolutely worth it. It tasted like Thanksgiving crammed into a burger. I love weird and new taste experiences, and this hit the spot. My only gripe is that they only accept cash tips. I don't usually carry cash and really wanted to tip the employee who came out to take my order.
I won't say it's the best burger I ever had, but it was weird and wonderfully delicious, which I love. I plan to stop in at every opportunity, and next time, I will make sure to have some cash for the waitstaff that deserves it.","We're pleased you loved our Thanksgiving burger, Patrick!

"My friends and I were in here Today. I asked fir a booth. No booths avaliable. Went into the bar found a table and sit down. Looked over and there was an empty booth. Went to ask the hostess, and was told it was reserved. I said you do not take reservations.  She said that is correct, but I like to hold this booth for 4 to 5 people.  All if the booths had 2 to 3 people. O.K. Waited 30 minutes to get a drink. This included water. Then another 30 minutes for her to take our order. Then another 20 minutes for our meal. Told the waitress we wanted to split our meal.  Came out on one plate, not cut in half. Saud there is an extra plate under the napkins. This plate was the size used fir a tea cup. Half of the sandwich would not fit on the plate.  The French fries were on a napkin. No place for ketup. Terrible. I ask about the the small plate. She said that is all she is aloud to use, or she gets into trouble. REALLY. I said next time charge me a dollar and bring a bigger plate. She laughed. I have ate at the restaurant at least twice a year for a long time. Unfortunately, not any more.
There was plenty of tables for 4 or more people. Think she was saving it for family or friends. Terrible hostess. 😡","Charlotte, we pride ourselves on our service, but it seems we fell short during your visit.

"TLDR; THIS is the place to get a legit barber at a reasonable price. Dave is phenomenal, but all the staff is diverse and provide immaculate cuts.

My girlfriend booked me a cut for my birthday, because I’m new to the area and nervous about trying new barbers, and when I pulled up to the mall I was even more nervous. But Dave and the rest of his staff proceeded to provide Spectacular service.
I’m NOT savvy with the proper terms for haircut/styles, but I know how I want my hair to look. With very little verbage from me, Dave provided the most spot on, immaculately detailed, and relaxing hair cut experience a man (or woman) could ever ask for. The type of cut that leaves you feeling more confident after leaving the chair.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE MEMBERSHIP. If you live in the area and your hair grows like a weed (like mine), the membership pays for itself.","We're happy to hear that your visit with us resulted in a positive experience, Anthony.

"What fun!  I passed by this on my way to the Dallas World Aquarium.  Love coffee and chocolate, so I ordered a cappuccino and 3 truffles, a raspberry, dark chocolate cordial and a cappuccino truffle.  The raspberry was my favorite.

"The service and the food is horrible. First of all, when we got there the attitude of the servers were not good. I usually don't care much about server attitude because they could just be having a bad day or a busy one. However I've heard multiple people who've been here say similar things about the service. The food was not good. My soup and my friend's soup was burnt. I didn't complain about mine but my friend did. The server came and tasted the soup before she took it away and replaced it for her.
Which was kinda weird to me. Why do you have to taste the soup when you can literally see the black particles in the soup? 
Anyways never coming back again.","Eileen, we sincerely apologize for not meeting your expectations during your recent visit.

"Came in on a Sunday night around 7:30 pm. It's starting to get cold and everyone else was also craving soup that day. It was about a 20-30 minute wait for 4 people. 

The banchan was really good! I loved the potato salad especially because it had no raisins and the kimchi was so freshh! The marinated cucumber was a bit over marinated for me personally.

We got the dinner combo with a tofu soup and bulgogi as well as the rice cake and dumpling soup

for the soup, we chose the seafood tofu soup at a spice level of ""very very spicy"" which came with oysters, clams, and shrimp

The rice cake and dumpling soup had good flavor and was comforting but the dumplings were a little overcooked and falling apart.

"I had the absolute pleasure of dining at Parker's On Ponce for my son's birthday on Saturday. He picked the restaurant and it was his 2nd choice but the 1st choice didn't allow kids under 10 and he wanted his nephew to celebrate with us, my grandbaby is 4. Well I am so glad we came here instead. First of all the staff was awesome! Friendly, personable, and even some eye candy here and there. I had the surf and turf and substituted the mashed potatoes for a loaded potato with no hassle. Delicious! Steak was chef's kiss! Tender, cooked to medium perfection, and seasoned perfectly! No steak sauce needed. Shrimp was so good as well. They had a handwritten birthday card for my son with a complimentary dessert. He ordered the PB&J cheesecake. He loved it! I had the chocolate pie for my dessert 10/10. My daughter had a seafood meal and I tasted her crab cake, awesome! Everything was great. I will definitely be eating here again very soon.","We're delighted you enjoyed your son's birthday celebration at our restaurant, Dee.

"Ok, this motel is what it is. It's not a 5 star but if you need to get a quiet nights sleep, it will do. However there's things I just can't tolerate. And at this establishment it's Roaches. Specifically on the ground floor. While the upstairs rooms have balconies, the ground rooms have patios that are basically just the part of the outside premises, so virtually anything can crawl inside. You can get better rates online but to walk up and pay $90-$100 per night and deal with roaches is unexplainable","Joey, it's sad to learn that we didn't meet your expectations for a peaceful night's sleep due to a pest issue.

"We had such a wonderful experience here for lunch. This property is huge: large bar, lots of indoor seating, a sunroom area and a very nice patio. The ambiance was very neutral, but in a good way. They had potted plants and hanging baskets that made you feel like staying for a while. Our server was very friendly and prompt with all our items. The beer selection is excellent! My burger was SO tasty and cooked a perfect medium rare. The grilled cheese my 5-year old got was gorgeously golden and on very nice, thick bread. My 2-year old got chicken nuggets and sweet potato fries. The nuggets were actual white meat pieces, fried nicely and looked homemade. We will definitely be back next time we are in the area.","Veronica, we're happy to know that you and your family enjoyed lunch with us!

"I recently visited your restaurant, expecting a pleasant experience as I had only been twice before. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the way the staff handled my simple request to sit outside with my small, 2-pound Pomeranian puppy, who was quietly sitting inside a bag.

To my surprise, I was denied the option to sit on the patio, with a staff member in a suit immediately questioning if my dog was a service animal. I found this approach a bit heavy-handed and frankly off-putting. It's a shame, as many other Tucson establishments--such as Sauce Pizzeria and Choice Greens--welcome patrons with small pets on their patios, providing a more accommodating experience.

While I had initially thought your restaurant was a decent spot, this experience has certainly changed my perspective. Combined with sushi that I would describe as mediocre at best, this visit has left me with no reason to return. I think it's worth considering how a more customer-friendly approach can make a significant difference.

"Upon approaching the building the area was clean of any trash and clear of hazards.  

There are two planters in the parking lot just in front of the doors and lantern lights on both sides.  Very nice look.

Then into the dining area further back is a large area with tables and along the far back area on the other side of the host area is a patio seating area which is where we sat. Relatively large size restaurant.  

We started with chips and three types of salsa, a water and a strawberry daiquiri. The pineapple looked rough, but the drink presentation and drink itself was delicious.  

We both ordered the shredded beef burritos. The dinner comes with a large burritos, rice, beans and a bunch of lettuce with a scoop of sour cream.

"Food: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

The cuisine is predominantly Italian, partly English. The restaurant had a humongous bar, I assume it would be flooded with patrons on the weekend evenings. I ordered Mozzarella cheese sticks that come with regular and spicy marinara. The spicy Marianara tasted like chilli oil, but the regular tasted great.

Not sure if they had more waitresses and servers, but on the day we visited there was 1 waitress working almost 10/15 patrons and was working extremely hard. I love the dedication and she probably needs a raise.

"We have been dining at Sarita’s for years!  Tonight,  I ordered a beef chimichanga and the waiter confirmed the order before he placed it.  When he brought my dinner, they made a mistake on the order and served me a bean chimichanga.  I asked that he please serve me what I ordered  but they refused to do that and offered a side of ground beef instead.  I had them credit the bill and cancel the order!  Never coming back!  We also ordered beef fajitas, cheese dip, beer, margaritas so it was not just one item on the menu that we ordered but obviously they do not value our patronage!","We sincerely apologize for your recent experience, Diane.

"They went so far above and beyond in repairing my 2011 Honda Accord. My front bumper was thrashed and needed replacing so Gary ordered me a new one. He kept me updated on the status of my repair and when I went to pick my car up (which was sooner than expected), they had fully cleaned and detailed my car inside and out. It was so clean and new looking that I literally didn't recognize my car on the lot. The bumper looks way better than before and they matched the paint perfectly.

Gary was the quickest to respond when I was shopping in the area for pricing. He gave me the best price out of all the shops and stayed true to that price from the first message he sent me. It makes me wonder why and how other places charge so much. Everyone on the team seems happy and loves their jobs, it's all smiles, and that shows in their work. There's a reason this place is busy and always has tons of cars on the lot, the word gets out!

Obviously nobody wants to have to take their car in for repairs but life happens and if you ever do, you'll be thanking yourself for coming here. This is my first time ever needing a body repair on my car and hopefully the last time, but I feel lucky that I found such a great shop and knowing that I can trust this place if I ever need it again. 10/10 would recommend",,"We're deeply touched by your kind words, Kevin!

My car was damaged on both sides and after getting quotes from over a dozen other shops, Gary and his team not only offered me an extremely fair price, but went above and beyond. My car came back looking BRAND NEW because on top of the repairs, they took the extra time and effort to detail my car, refill air in the tires, and polish out any additional scratches.

His two boys brought the safe on time and installed with great care and professionalism.  Really great young men, clearly taught well and just plain nice to deal with.

"I am usually the person - if you do not have nice things to say, don't say anything at all kind of person but this experience was just an absolutely the worst restaurant experience I have ever had...
Older well dressed man greeted us and we were party of 3 but 2 of us arrived earlier. I asked if we can wait at the table or bar and he asked when other person will arrive and I said should be on time and I told him again, we do not mind waiting at the bar. He was very rude and irritated by my answer but he showed us table. So it was VERY "" welcoming"" to start.
We ordered dozen oysters and it was correct order (on thing that they did right),  but soup was wrong, drink was wrong so we just gave up and paid and left.
Not worth to pay any money at this place.
And to mention at the last, we were group of non causations, so could be simply it was racism.
We will never go back nor recommend this place.

I am changing from 2 to 1 star but if I could, it will be 0.","We sincerely apologize for your unpleasant experience, Miki.

"(Translated by Google) Hello, we gave each other the “yes” word here on October 10th, 2024. It was a fantastically beautiful experience for us; generally being able to get married in this beautiful chapel during our trip to the USA. Everything just worked from start to finish. First, organizing the booking (including the Marriage License Bureau); then the ceremony and finally the trusting collaboration on the missing documents at the end! We can really recommend the chapel to every couple! Thank you very much for everything Bert & Janet Eberius from Saxony🙏🫶💞

"I understand the critical role wheel bearings play in keeping us safe on the road, so when I was told mine needed to be replaced, I didn’t take it lightly.

Jose even offered to give me a ride to my office, which was a nice touch, especially since I work in Poway. Eric took down my details, and sure enough, they arranged transportation for me while my car was being repaired. Once the work was done, I couldn’t wait to get back on the road.

"Today, I had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant. My wife decided to take me there for my birthday. I had the chance to try the side salad, and the Shepherd’s Pie. My wife had the  sea seafarer’s chowder, the roast beef and we shared the beer batter shrimp. We ordered ice cream and bread pudding it was incredible. Everything was delicious and our waitress was awesome. You really get a lot of food here. We need a doggie bag for the leftovers. If you are in the area please make it a point to stop by and grab some delicious food. My compliments to the chef that prepared our food.

"In town to visit my girls at college and came up to this place after a basketball game. Walked in at 9 PM on a Saturday night and the place was packed. At least 100 people in the building. The hostess asked if we had a reservation and I said no since we decided last minute to go. She said oh I’m sorry the kitchen’s closed if you don’t have a reservation. I said if I had answered that question yes you would’ve sat us and she couldn’t have been more rude and dismissive And when I said all we’re getting is a pizza and a salad she said no I’m sorry we were very busy tonight and everyone’s very tired. Had to go back and get my car from the valet who had buried it somewhere, but I cannot believe that they wouldn’t seat someone at 9 o’clock on a Saturday night. And the rudeness was unbelievable.

"I purchased my Honda CRV just over a month ago, and unfortunately, it was damaged at Mr. Shine Car Wash on Lake Pleasant Pkwy in Peoria, AZ. After my car went through the brushes, vertical cloth strip curtains, and other sections of the wash, the grill blew off by the air during the drying process, as seen in the video they reviewed. Despite this, the car wash is refusing to take responsibility for the damage, saying it’s not covered and suggesting the dealership or manufacturer is at fault. It’s frustrating to see them dodge accountability and show such disregard for their customers!

Aside from needing to replace my grill, my car was very clean. Really glad I decided not to sign up for the membership.","We sincerely apologize for your recent visit, Susie.

The food was exceptional, with each dish bursting with authentic flavors and beautifully presented. The menu offered a variety of options that catered to all tastes, and everything we tried was delicious. It truly elevated the dining experience and made the celebration even more memorable.

The ambiance of the restaurant was perfect for the occasion. The cozy and inviting atmosphere, combined with the charming decor, created a warm and welcoming setting for our celebration.

"My kids had a great time HOWEVER 2 employees were harassing us about keeping the BALLS in the BALL pitt. Mind you, this a BALL factory playground. There are BALLS everywhere bc it is a BALL FACTORY.

"It's been years since I came to Sekiya's Delicatessen!

I was in the area, so a short walk to Sekiya's was meant to be!

I looked at the offerings and read a sign about a BIG Bento! That sounded like it would have a little of everything good. At $9.55, it came with chow fun or fried noodles, tsukemono, namasu, ONE PIECE shoyu chicken. One small piece of Teriyaki meat, plain white rice musubi, one piece maki sushi, and a small 1/3 shoyu hot dog.  You can add a drink for a dollar. 

Somewhat disappointed in the bento size. As you can see in the photos, it's not a Big Bento : ). I think I would rename it to Sekiya's Bento. 

I also ordered sides of the bean stir fry, a vegetable tempura and sweet potato tempura. Now the size of the take out for the sides is Big! Sadly, I thought I took a picture of the sides, but I forgot too. It came in a large size take out plate lunch container. 

The bean stir fry was amazing, flavorful and delicious! I will go back for more of this dish. 

The vegetable tempura was perfectly fried crisp, but a no go for me because it was mostly onions lol. The sweet potato tempura was nice and a bit oily. 

The bento was packed, however the portions are small. I thought it would be enough for both of us. Good thing I ordered the sides. 

Everything came out to just under $20.  

The restaurant is small and quaint. Sit down tables and chairs are with local decor. 

Overall, clean and a great place to pick up takeout or eat indoor!

Service was pretty quick and with a smile. 

Support local. 

Overall good: 3.5/5 stars 
Ambiance: 3.5/5 stars
Price: 3.5/5 stars 

Rounded up to 4 stars due to the green bean stir fry!","We're pleased you enjoyed our bean stir-fry and tempura dishes, Jackie! Your thoughtful feedback is appreciated. However, we regret that our Bento size didn't meet your expectations, as our aim is to offer a satisfying and varied meal with these boxes.

"I live locally and used to come here once a week with friends and family. This is always the place I recommend to friends and visitors when they ask for the go-to spot. I'm known by my friends for only ever wanting to go to Clayton's Bistro! 
However... we went here for breakfast today for the first time in several months, and we were so disappointed by the service. The gentleman in the front who seated us was absolutely amazing, and he even asked us if we needed water for our pups and was aware of our needs. Our waitress was really not the best, sadly. I know what being a waitress is like from experience, so I'm able to look past missing the mark in a few places because of the other influences on your ability to service well, but this was every aspect of our experience that she missed. She forgot everything we asked for, never brought us water, we paid $5 each for our cups of coffee and she never offered a refill... we waited FOREVER for her to ask us for our order, and then she never asked if we needed anything else, and we sat there for about 20 minutes waiting for the check. And they were not busy until we left because we were there early on a Saturday. So I can't even say I understood because they were busy... there were many empty tables. 
I hope the service is addressed because I want to be able to recommend Clayton's Bistro without saying ""but the service is very poor.""","We sincerely apologize for your recent experience.

"I tried this business based on previous reviews.  I got my food to go. The burger had no taste. The fries (which I had upgraded to large) were crispier than I had anticipated. They also had no taste (guess I was hoping for juicier fries like Mission BBQ).  Don't plan to try this business again.

"I wanted a place where I could try multiple items that I had to buy for full price.  This place was mentioned several times in several reviews so I went to try them out.  I was glad I did. I got the creole sampler which has a platter of Shrimp Creole, Jambalaya and Red Beans and Rice and I got a cup of gumbo. They claim it a large plate nut it wasn't but it was plenty of food. They also give you some bread. 

They were busy but the waitress did a great job visiting her tables.  She was good in multi tasking which made her a great waitress.","Alan, we're glad you enjoyed the Creole sampler and our gumbo.

"Went for lunch. Served loaf of French bread which is nice. Had crawfish etouffee which was weirdly sweet. No need for that. Also, only warm, not hot. Husband got shrimp remoulade salad which looked pretty good. I love strong ice tea but this was so strong and astringent. When it arrived the ice was melted so I had to request a side glass of ice. 

Service good and reasonably priced. Okay but just not special enough to return to  in a city with so many great Creole restaurants. 

Note: shrimp and crawfish are imported which is sad. But at least they're honest about it.","Holly, we're pleased our service met your expectations, but we understand that there were areas that fell short.

"Best Burger Ever

This place is super popular with my friends. It's close to the school we all used to work at together so we ended up here a lot. They have great food and magical margaritas that come in a cute little mason jar. One is always enough for me.

The habanero chicken isn't spicy to me but the flavors were good enough it didn't matter. The rice bowl surprised me at first since that's usually an Asian thing but every one I've tried has been fabulous. Bring on the cultural mixing!

They have burgers here that taste like what angels eat. I mean, seriously, I don't even like burgers and I would get another burger from here. They're legitimately juicy and tasy and goodness have mercy I am craving their burgers and that's pretty much never happened before. My favorite of all time is the Loco Moco, which is such an off-putting name (crazy booger) but it tastes so good I just ignore the gross name. Their Chipotle Burger also comes with really good sauce. The Jalapeno Burger was surprisingly my least favorite of them all.

I didn't like the Seafood Fajita Dinner but I know I've had Mahi Mahi and liked it before. I guess I like it better with some kind of sauce or something. It was seasoned and grilled but didn't have much flavor. One was chewy and when I mentioned it (TMJ makes it difficult to eat chewy stuff) the manager was super cool about it and brought me some extra shrimp to fix it. I liked the shrimp a lot but the rest of the Shrimp Fajitas just didn't do it for me. I would get more things with shrimp in them but I think I am done with the fajitas.

The Chimichurri Shrimp is amazing with dirty rice and pinto beans. I loved mixing those together. Their guac is ok (not chunky enough for me). I think I prefer the El Diablo chicken in enchiladas and the grilled chicken in quesadillas. I also really liked the tequila lime chicken in the rice bowl moreso than in the nachos but hubby liked it in his build your own burrito done Maria's Way. The cilantro-lime rice is not surprisingly pretty boring by itself. Overall it's been an enjoyable experience every visit.

To try:
chocolate brownie sundae
churro ice cream sundae
deep fried cheesecake a la mode
dirty rice bowl (chipotle, grilled chicken)
fajita flanksteak rice bowl
marinated chipotle chicken tacos
marias crispy catfish platter

We're glad our burgers, particularly the Loco Moco, and margaritas in mason jars were to your liking. We regret that our Seafood Fajita Dinner wasn't up to par, but we appreciate your feedback. It's pleasing to know our manager amended the situation with extra shrimp.

It's exciting that you relished our broad menu range, including Chimichurri Shrimp with dirty rice, pinto beans, El Diablo chicken enchiladas, and tequila lime chicken rice bowls. Looking forward, we hope you'll try our crowd-pleasing desserts and our $7.49 lunch special served from 11am-2pm.

We pride ourselves on our vibrant bar setting and our Prickly Pear Margarita is a popular choice. We hope you'll also enjoy watching a game on one of our widescreen TVs during your next visit. Our quesadillas, featuring a 12-inch tortilla, 3-cheese mix, and smoked pulled pork, are also a hit. 

If you enjoyed our Loco Moco and BBQ burgers, we suspect our Jalapeno Burger will be another winner. We're delighted that you appreciate our friendly staff and family-oriented atmosphere, and your repeated enjoyable visits are our goal. 

We eagerly anticipate your next visit and hope you'll continue discovering new favorites on our menu.","Here is the <yelp> Review <Best Burger Ever

This place is super popular with my friends. Its close to the school we all used to work at together so we ended up here a lot. They have great food and magical margaritas that come in a cute little mason jar. One is always enough for me.

The habanero chicken isnt spicy to me but the flavors were good enough it didnt matter. The rice bowl surprised me at first since thats usually an Asian thing but every one Ive tried has been fabulous. Bring on the cultural mixing!

They have burgers here that taste like what angels eat. I mean, seriously, I dont even like burgers and I would get another burger from here. Theyre legitimately juicy and tasy and goodness have mercy I am craving their burgers and thats pretty much never happened before. My favorite of all time is the Loco Moco, which is such an off-putting name (crazy booger) but it tastes so good I just ignore the gross name. Their Chipotle Burger also comes with really good sauce. The Jalapeno Burger was surprisingly my least favorite of them all.

I didnt like the Seafood Fajita Dinner but I know Ive had Mahi Mahi and liked it before. I guess I like it better with some kind of sauce or something. It was seasoned and grilled but didnt have much flavor. One was chewy and when I mentioned it (TMJ makes it difficult to eat chewy stuff) the manager was super cool about it and brought me some extra shrimp to fix it. I liked the shrimp a lot but the rest of the Shrimp Fajitas just didnt do it for me. I would get more things with shrimp in them but I think I am done with the fajitas.

The Chimichurri Shrimp is amazing with dirty rice and pinto beans. I loved mixing those together. Their guac is ok (not chunky enough for me). I think I prefer the El Diablo chicken in enchiladas and the grilled chicken in quesadillas. I also really liked the tequila lime chicken in the rice bowl moreso than in the nachos but hubby liked it in his build your own burrito done Marias Way. The cilantro-lime rice is not surprisingly pretty boring by itself. Overall its been an enjoyable experience every visit.

To try:
chocolate brownie sundae
churro ice cream sundae
deep fried cheesecake a la mode
dirty rice bowl (chipotle, grilled chicken)
fajita flanksteak rice bowl
marinated chipotle chicken tacos
marias crispy catfish platter

"We saw this place on YouTube and decided to try it since we were flying into Miami and the hype was not worth it. We got there a little before they opened the dining room and gave our name and once they opened they just started calling names, and it was almost like a stampede of people rushing to a waiting waiter/waitress like they were going to lose out on their table. It reminds us of when a plane starts to board or lands and everyone rushes to get on or off for no reason. I even got bumped out of the way by some old lady, so I just stood to the side until the crowd settled. On to the food, we ordered the large stone crabs and made it a meal which came with three sides and a slice of key lime pie. We ended up ordering the spinach, cole slaw and potatoes as our sides. We also got the fried chicken and ahi tuna. The wife got a $20 mango mojito which was nothing special and definitely not worth the price. The stone crabs were honestly nothing to write home about and before sitting I took a postcard to write home about them, but I decided not to and threw it out. The fried chicken was nothing special either and really had no flavor to it and the breast was dry. The key lime pie was 85% frozen but at least the whipped cream tasted good. We think the best part of the meal was the potatoes and the bread. The service was good, but we won't be back. Free parking across the street. Overall, it's over priced and overrated.","We apologize for not meeting your expectations. We pride ourselves on our food and service, and it appears we fell short this time.

"4.5 stars 

Came here on Thursday night... Staff was friendly and food came out (hot and) quickly. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place. I got the lobster ravioli ($22) and my friend got the lasagna for $17.95. The creaminess of the ravioli sauce offset some of the flavor of the peppers. Both portions were large enough that we had leftovers to take home and the bread that came with the meals was good. A great recommendation by my aunt (as this is one of her favorite places). Would've liked to check out the dessert selections, but maybe next time

"Great location and lots of potential. It felt pretty clean and I'd come with the family for something to do. The food is basically what you'd get at a gas station though. Chips and salsa were Tostitos with a peel top Tostitos salsa. Fries and boneless wings were obviously something from Cisco. Blue cheese was poured from a Kraft bottle. For the price, I'd look somewhere else.

"I don't want to be too harsh because I get the realities of making guaranteed fixes, especially when labor costs almost as much as, if not more than parts. However I was recently quoted $485 plus tax to repair my washer.  I was able to fix it myself for $10 in about 30 minutes.

The quote covered $285 for an entire stator assembly plus $200 labor. It did not cover the $109 I had to pay for the initial consultation visit.

After investigating parts numbers for my washer I determined that I could get the same stator for closer to $130 - but that's on Amazon and I understand going through trusted suppliers.

But then looking further, many internet posts mention that the stator rarely goes bad, it is almost always the position sensor (a $10-$30 part depending on supplier)

So, even though I did not want to, I pulled the back of my washer apart. If a stator goes bad you will usually see some kind of burn marks from an electrical short. Lo and behold my stator looks fine. I took a shot and ordered the position sensor ($10) After a couple days it arrived in the mail and now my washer works like new. The stator has to come out either way and the part clips to it, it is no more work. It took maybe 30 minutes in total, and I've never worked on a washer before.

I get that if they quote the cheaper part and then it's the more expensive part I'm then on the hook for multiple support visits, which is why I'm trying to be measured here, but this was pretty absurd.","We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, Jake.

"Not my first time here and was looking forward to a good meal. Waitress did not know the specials for the day when I ordered a bowl of beef barley soup and questioned why I ordered it. I should have stopped there. It looked and tasted like a can of Campbell’s Soup. Ordered the Caesar salad and it arrived looking like it had gone through a lawn mower. The romaine was chopped, saturated with bottled dressing and the croutons all dumped in a bowl. The pictures taken actually make it look better than it did on arrival and after I had mixed it up. Found one small sliver of what I think was Parmesan. The saving grace to this meal was the fried green beans with ranch dipping sauce. Outer coating was crunchy, arrived hot and tasted like green beans. The 5 oz Dunkel Beer had a good malty flavor and reminded my friend of Germany. Service hard to get. Waitress was assigned all over restaurant and took a while to bring bill. Got very loud during time there which made it hard to have a conversation without having to speak up to be heard. Sorry to say will not be returning.",,"We sincerely apologize for your recent experience at our restaurant, Shari. It's evident from your feedback that we fell short on several aspects.

"The food was excellent. Casual, high quality eats. Mostly American (or Americanized) options. The seasonal drinks sounded amazing, but I didn't try them tonight, so if drinks are your thing, ask for the seasonal specials. The brussel sprouts appetizer was amazing, as were the fries, and pita bread served with my gyro. I will absolutely eat here again!

Atmosphere gets 3 stars, because the visual vibe is great, but it is very loud during peek hours.

Sound (ie, can I hear my partner at the table talk?):
If you are sensitive to overwhelm due to sound, eat here during the slow hours of the day or ask to be seated outside (it's lovely when the weather is just right).
Terrible sound quality in the architecture (lots of echoing, no softening of sound) and too much music + sports news + diners chatting all at the same time. I had to talk loud to be heard, but I did not have to yell.
Light (for those headache days and photo-sensitive folks):
Canned and other over-head lights are bright, but not horrible (the lighting outside is a bit softer, though).
Seats (for those with physical needs):
I sat in a booth. The seat was not broken in and was well placed regarding distance to the table - I was comfortable. There were a lot of basic high backed chairs that looked decently comfortable. Bring your cushion if hard seats are difficult and booths are out of the question.
Accessibility:
It looked wheelchair accessible, but not super easy. Typical restaurant tightness. But worth it.",,"Kat, we're thrilled you enjoyed our food and recognized its quality.

"Disappointing!  October 27
My family and I traveled from Boston to celebrate a special birthday.  We specifically picked Miami because Joe's stone was always my favorite for special occasions, and I wanted to share that with my family who had not dined there.  I wanted them to love it as much as I did.  The initial greeting by the maitre'd was attentive and welcoming, and we were given a choice of a inside or outside table; we chose the outside patio since it was a beautiful night.  That might have been our first mistake, obviously, the B team must be assigned to that area based on the service we received.
After about 15 minutes, the waiter arrived at our table, took our drink order, and reviewed the menu with us, strongly recommended the fried chicken as an appetizer, which we thought was kind of odd.  He also shared that Joe's is now open year round, but when asked about the stone crab season only being until May, he stated ""we serve frozen stone crabs in the summer"", again which seemed an odd thing to say. He also said the restaurant does about 150 dinners per night, which seemed way off the mark.  I had no idea the restaurant was open year round, since your website said opening night was Oct. 15?  It was just a preview of what was to become a really bad experience at Joe's.
After waiting a long time for the drinks, we figured we better order our appetizers while we had his attention.  The crab bisque and calamari were good, wedge salad was unimpressive, with a half an iceberg lettuce  with s steak knife sticking out the middle, a small of bacon and blue cheese, nothing special.
Again, we sat for a very long time waiting for someone to clear our plates and take our dinner order.  Our waiter seemed to be frazzled and overwhelmed.  2 out of 4 of us ordered stone crabs, he recommended putting them on one plate to share, which we agreed.  I also asked for drawn butter in addition to the mustard sauce, waiter said "" that will drown out the taste of the stone crab, but I guess I will bring it.""  When the entrees arrived, the waiter brought empty plates for the stone crabs to be shared,  but forgot to order one of the entrees, which was the grouper.  He said he would be right back with it, but everyone at the table was 3/4 of the way through dinner before the grouper arrived.  When I asked again about the drawn butter, he said "" I wish I had more than two hands, then you would have it.' It never arrived until I flagged down a busboy to ask again for the butter.  The sides which I always loved at Joes were terrible, baked potato was cold, creamed spinach was weirdly overspiced,  and hash browns very greasy.  To make matter worse, the waiter brought the wine list so we could order wine with dinner, but never came back to the table to take the order.  At this point, we asked to speak to a manager.  The manager was very gracious and apologized, and offered to buy a round of drinks, or that she would remove the first round from the bill, and buy dessert. Nobody at the table wanted another drink at this point, since the evening was such a disaster.  She also removed the grouper from the bill since my husband did not even eat it, it arrived so long after the other entrees did.  But she never took off the drinks from the check as previously promised.  We then ordered just two desserts, since the key lie pie at Joe's has always been the gold standard by which I judge all other key lime pies, it is that good.  Sadly, it was the final insult to the evening, key lime pie had ice crystals like it had been previously frozen.  And no acknowledgement about the birthday celebration that I was seeing at other tables.  Hmm, frozen items at Joes?  Hard to believe.
Was this a bad night at Joe's?  Would I return or recommend Joe's?   Not after this experience,  it was such a contrast to previous visits.  And pay no attention to the dress code, anything goes at Joe's, apparently.  In closing, what was supposed to be the highlight of a birthday celebration trip, ended up being the biggest disappointment of our trip to Miami.","We're sad that your experience with us did not meet your expectations, especially for such an important occasion, Ann.

"Terrible service. Took my jeep in for some spark plug wires and they fixed those but the radio no longer worked. My warranty covered the radio and they ordered one, then another one, then I think a third one. Each time a little worse. When I brought it up the last time the service person said it sounded fine to her. Finally the service manager came out and agreed there was distortion. He thought it was the speakers now. They kept it again and changed out the tweeters and still there was distortion. He told me that my Jeep was old and the speakers were probably wore out from taking the roof or doors off (I haven’t). Basically, they were done with it. I realize that my expectations were too high. I thought they’d actually fix the issues with the radio (that worked fine until I took it in to them).","Jason, we sincerely apologize for the difficulties you've experienced with your Jeep's radio.

"The room was well appointed with a kitchenette which had a stovetop, refrigerator and sink, what more could one need? The outer room was large and comfy, not fancy but everything we needed. Bedroom door closed and provided a separate space from sleeper sofa in outer area. Bed was comfy and the bathroom was clean and had a good shower.
My taking away one star for location is only because of the outside area. Cabin like patio faced a beautiful wooded area which  I loved until I walked out at sunrise to find it covered in animal fecal matter, it was smelly and not sure what animal had dropped it?
Free breakfast was delicious, lots of healthy organic cereal choices and even had plant milk., coffee was good, too.

"Since it's been so cold lately, we decided that more tofu soup was the answer. What's great about this location is that you can join the Yelp Waitlist from afar, and wait in the comfort of your own home. I was a little embarrassed to find out that their texting system isn't 100% accurate though, so I'd come a little earlier than the projected time as they might have your table ready (turnover is FAST). Inside is tight, cozy, and bustling so there isn't much room to move around. I ended up getting the Galbi tofu soup, but I was able to try my partner's dinner combo with chicken bulgogi. Hitters after hitters - the chicken is so tender, juicy, and flavorful. We also love the sides here, whether it's the little fish, thick fish cakes, or cucumbers. Probably my favorite Kaju location as of right now!","We're happy you enjoyed our tofu soup, Valerie!

"No matter the time of day/year, the food is always tastefully fantastic! Atmosphere is laid back and kid friendly. The prices are slightly high, but the food is fresh, so you get what you pay for, and it's well worth it as well as proportionate. You'll always take leftovers home (or back to your hotel or cruise) for another great meal. You can see the beach from every seat in the house. There is an upstairs with outside seating, but be careful, the seagulls will help with your leftovers. But please do not feed them as they will poop everywhere this causing a nasty mess and smell. Walk across the street and feed them ;) Hostess, waiters, and waitresses are always the same, which tells me the company treats their employees well, and in return, they take excellent care of the customers. I'm becoming a regular and I think they somehow know I'm always there for the can and corn chowder lol. If you haven't tried the chowder, ask for a sample. It does have a bit of a zest, so those who do not like or can not handle a light spice may not like it. You can also place pick up orders. Oh and depending on the time of day there is usually a wait sometimes 20-30 minutes. But no worries take a quick stroll on the beach, grab some seashells and your table will be ready before you know it. All in all this is a well worth eatery. Enjoy!","Melissa, we're happy to know you're a regular patron and a fan of our clam and corn chowder! We take pride in serving fresh food in a relaxed setting with a fantastic view. It's pleasing that our consistent staff hasn't gone unnoticed. We prioritize their well-being so they can deliver top-notch service to awesome customers like you.

"Located between two more contemporary buildings, this is a steakhouse with a twist. You get to select your own protein (chicken, meat or shrimp) and a side.
The side gets brought to your table but the protein you get to cook yourself. There's a sign on the wall that tells you how many minutes to cook something depending on how you want it.
Service was no frills, friendly, courteous. Our server was very knowledgeable. Tables felt a little on the small side but you make it work.

"Best Tom Kha Kai (coconut chicken soup) and Pad Kra Pow in DFW. 
Also terrific basil stir fries.
100% consistent and fresh, with very generous portions, Thai Select never lets you down.
Picking up your own take-out is as good as dining in, which is hard to accomplish.

Places, specifically Door Dash, really jack up the prices completely obscenely.

The food was okay. I probably won't go back. The service was terrible. My waiter just dropped my food off and never returned to ask was I ok or did I need anything else which I did. So after not seeing him for awhile he finally popped up. I asked for a carryout box and another waiter heard me asking so he gave it to me. So I guess it wasn't enough people in my party for him to pay any attention to a one party  table.

"We waited well over and hour for our food. Kept seeing people that arrived after us getting their orders. The server was nice and was apologetic but no real excuse for why our food took so long; no compensation for the lateness either. The manager came over and apologized but no offer of money off or even a free drink! The food was nothing to write home about either. I ordered the tuna steak and didn't eat it. I love sushi and don't have any qualms about eating raw fish; however, this tuna steak they delivered appeared not edible. Do not recommend this place.","Lisa, we sincerely apologize for not meeting your expectations. We understand your disappointment with the wait time and assure you it's not our norm.

"We've had many enjoyable meals at The Smokehouse, always appreciating the high-quality food and service. However, this time, our experience fell short of what we've come to expect. 

The usually excellent dirty martini was off, and the French onion soup came out lukewarm twice, even after being sent back. The steak salad lacked its usual quality and arrived without the requested dressing on the side, which took additional time to receive. Service was not up to its usual standards; it felt like our server kept disappearing, and we waited an unusually long time for everything. We also mentioned our reservation was for two birthdays, but there was no acknowledgment, while other tables had birthday celebrations. 

We hope this was an isolated incident, as The Smokehouse has always been a favorite of ours, and we hope to experience their usual excellence if and when we decide to return.","Michele, we sincerely apologize that your recent visit fell short of the high expectations we uphold.

"Montana Meat Company is a 24/7 reasonably priced steakhouse/diner/bar/some Gaming Type of place with two locations in Las Vegas. The Centennial location is kinda dark in the dining room and is booth seating. 

I tried the macadamia halibut special. When I looked at it I really didn't think the fish looked like halibut but can be cut that way so maybe it was. The fish was mild tasting and prepared nicely. The baked potato was really great. It had a nice crust and a super fluffy interior and it came with soft whipped butter. The Baked potato was really great. The Jalapeño Cream Corn was strange. Usually creamed corn has a velvety kind of texture. The Creamed Corn here was kernels with cream poured over.....

My husband tried the Filet Medallions with Macaroni and Cheese and Onion Rings. The steaks were prepared nicely and also were tender. It wasn't the most flavorful but was tender. He said the onion rings would have been very good if they weren't so greasy tonight. The macaroni and cheese was better than from a lot of places and wasn't mushy like you usually get.

Some things were better than other things so it's worth a try.

Service was good but seemed on the slow side.

The Centennial location is kinda dark in the dining room and is booth seating. 

I tried the macadamia halibut special. When I looked at it I really didnt think the fish looked like halibut but can be cut that way so maybe it was. The fish was mild tasting and prepared nicely. The baked potato was really great. It had a nice crust and a super fluffy interior and it came with soft whipped butter. The Baked potato was really great. The Jalapeño Cream Corn was strange. Usually creamed corn has a velvety kind of texture. The Creamed Corn here was kernels with cream poured over.....

My husband tried the Filet Medallions with Macaroni and Cheese and Onion Rings. The steaks were prepared nicely and also were tender. It wasnt the most flavorful but was tender. He said the onion rings would have been very good if they werent so greasy tonight. The macaroni and cheese was better than from a lot of places and wasnt mushy like you usually get.

Some things were better than other things so its worth a try.

Service was good but seemed on the slow side.

"I've only been there once and want to be fair but I feel compelled to leave a review to tamp down the current 4.6 rating. Our food was very average although I'm sure we didn't order their best. Service from both our waitress and bussers was amateurish while we observed very professional servers at other tables. Decor is ok but the restaurant has not been completely rebuilt as you might have expected after Crown Palace was closed so long ago. The carpet is gone (thank God) and there's a new bartop along with a good cleaning throughout but it's basically the same place.

We ordered Calamari, an arugula salad and veal saltimbocca. None were remarkable. The calamari was cooked to brown with no tentacles - seemed like a food service item. The salad was overdressed and offered precious little goat cheese as the advertised ingredient. The veal was heavily bread crumbed and cooked to near crispy. Sauce was extremely heavy and overwhelmed the pasta we substituted for potato and veg.

We ordered a cheap bottle of wine - admittedly late in the process - and after waiting a while were told it wasn't available. Ok then, bring two glasses of the house cab. The bottle appeared on our bill anyway. It got fixed....but still.

The owner came thru with some free desserts but we really didn't want dessert. These were also unremarkable. In case your wondering - because the dessert menu includes no descriptions - the cheesecake is NY style and the cannoli are miniature and extremely sweet.

I will wait awhile and see how the place develops before I go back. If and when I do  I'll spring for the specialty meats if I can get a straight answer about prices. Stuff in the case up front looked phenomenal but it's not on the menu. I guess you have to ask specifically about each one.

In the meantime, I'll enjoy the Italian staples at Naples in Campbell's Junction, Palumbo's in Hazlet or Toscanella Village in Middletown for half the price.

i would have given it five stars till the second visit we went . 
the server was alright but our meal was not the best. 

we ordered the rangoons which came in the middle freezing cold . then we ordered a coconut soup which was good and very lemony from the lemon grass .

When the waiter came over, we asked very nicely if the TV could be turned off or the channel changed.  If not we asked to change seats. His response was he didn’t care about the election and the  Sound was off, so we shouldn’t be bothered by it at all.  Instead, We could look out  the window at the beautiful view,  but there was absolutely no view because it was pitch black outside. The only view we saw was the reflection of the TV  and Fox News which reflected in the window. I went to the front desk and again asked to move. A gentleman who said he was the owner, told us there was no need to move. We could go back to our seats and he would change the channel, just to give him a few minutes. (we really didn’t understand why we couldn’t change our seat and come into the main dining room.  The restaurant was empty inside. None of the tables were being used so maybe he just didn’t want to start using inside.). The TV  channel  was changed as we were walking back to our table, but in the middle of our meal it went right back to Fox News again .  We were very upset that this happened.  We finished our meal  which   was  excellent, but we will never go back to Carlucci’s again because of this TV situation.  If  we wanted to watch what was happening with the election, we could have gone to a bar or actually sat at the bar at Carlucci’s.  We are very very disappointed  that our evening out at  Carlucci’s was so upsetting.  We  came for a relaxing evening, and ended up becoming even more aggravated.","We regret to hear about your recent experience, Reva.

He says, ma’am, we have one inspector and 4/5 cars, it will be several hours.

"Food overall was quite mid. One thing to note was that the salad was decent. The prawn was plump and had a bouncy, tasty texture to it.

The New England clam chowder was quite salty and honestly, it tasted very similar to a canned clam chowder from the grocery store.

For the stores most popular item, the oyster pan roast, it tasted exactly the same as the clam chowder but less salty. It had 3 oysters in it and honestly, the meal felt too creamy when both the New England clam chowder and the pan roast are ordered. The pan roast didn’t taste like anything special and didn’t have a good wow factor to me.

Moving onto the service, our server didn’t seem very attentive. We got our water filled maybe 2 times throughout the whole meal and we were left with no water quite often.

Overall, it seemed like Grand Central Oyster Bar is a place with a great atmosphere, though it really fits the needs of a tourist which is a nice vibe and cool location. Wouldn’t fully recommend the food.",,"Ethan, thank you for your comprehensive feedback. We're pleased you enjoyed our atmosphere and the prawn dish.

"Words truly can’t describe how blessed we were to have Doris as our florist. From our first appointment to the day we said I do, Doris made every moment so unbelievably special for us. Our first appointment we went over all over our inspiration pictures, Doris was able to help with her professional input to create the best vision possible. Our second appointment, was for us to go in and see a mock up of what our centerpieces and bouquets would look like. Not many florists give you the opportunity to physically see what you will be getting. That day was so special to us, that’s when it hit us! We were really getting married. Doris beyond exceeded our expectations, the florals at the wedding were so beautiful. I would like to use the word “grand” but that’s an understatement. They were magical, truly gorgeous. Doris is such a loving person inside and out, she truly cares about her bride and grooms. And will do everything possible to make your vision come true. Don’t walk, RUN! P.S - my photographer with 20 years of experience said he’s never seen a wedding bouquet as lovely as mine!!#sorrynotsorry DORIS WE THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS.

"Kaju Soft Tofu Restaurant is a consistently enjoyable spot for a casual dining experience. I've been coming to this location for years, typically at least once a year for dinner, and I usually order the Kaju Special Dinner Combo D along with extra rice. The food quality is excellent overall, and it has consistently met my expectations.

The restaurant offers ample parking, so finding a spot is rarely an issue. The ambiance is lively, which adds to its casual charm, though there is often a short wait for a table. This bustling atmosphere makes it clear that the restaurant is popular and attracts many repeat customers.

The main area where Kaju Soft Tofu Restaurant falls short is in its service. While I appreciate the hard work of the staff, many of whom seem to be from Korea and may be dealing with language barriers, the experience often feels rushed. The servers seem eager to move diners along, likely to accommodate the high volume of guests. Although I understand the challenges of a busy restaurant, this aspect of the service can sometimes detract from the overall dining experience.

Despite these concerns, I would still recommend Kaju Soft Tofu Restaurant, primarily for the quality of its food. If you're looking for a casual yet delicious meal, it's worth a visit.","Nathan, we're happy you're a regular patron and that our Kaju Special Dinner Combo D continually meets your standards.

"I recently reached out to Bio Genetics Lab and did a genetic test for cancer risk, and I am so glad I took the step to learn more about my health. The process was surprisingly easy — Bio Genetics did a medical intake over the phone and that information was sent to my doctor. Once the doctor ordered the test the lab sent me the kit to provide a saliva sample. The results came back in a few weeks, and I was able to schedule a consultation with my doctor to go over the findings.
The test analyzed genes linked to higher risks of various cancers, including breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. Fortunately, my results came back negative for the most common cancer-related mutations (like BRCA1 and BRCA2), which was a relief. However, I also learned that there are other factors at play, like lifestyle and family history, that I need to consider.
I appreciate how thorough the testing process was. The genetic counselor I spoke to explained everything in detail, ensuring I understood the results and steps I could take going forward.
If you have a family history of cancer or just want to be proactive about your health, I highly recommend considering genetic testing should you quality. It gave me peace of mind and a clearer picture of my health risks. It's not just about finding out if you have a mutation — it's about knowing how to manage your health in the best way possible moving forward.
Overall, I had a great experience, and I'm really glad I took this step in understanding my cancer risks. It’s empowering to have that knowledge!","Thank you for your positive feedback on our genetic testing process. Our aim is to provide clear, comprehensive information to our patients. If you need any assistance, feel free to reach out.","Thank you for your thoughtful feedback on our genetic testing process.

"I wasn't super thrilled, it was my first time there and maybe I'd give it another shot. Had the ribs, Mac and cheese and fries. Ribs were really fatty and just not a lot of flavor.

"I been here a few times because the food is good. However this last time, on 11/4, left a very bad taste! We arrived and was ignored at the hostess podium. A waiter finally asked where we like to seat, we chose outside,  because it was a very nice day. Of all the tables available,  he put us on a small table at the end against the wall looked at a pile of boxes. He did put us at a better table with an umbrella across the sidewalk at my request. Than he brought only ONE menu, said will be right back with a 2nd menu. He never returned. Another 15 minutes later, other couples all were seated at larger tables closed to the restaurant center, and they received attention before us, simply cos they were all closer to the door, despite us there a good 10 minutes prior,we were the last table! Finally, 15 minutes after seated, another waiter came to take our order, at this point, I decided I am getting bad vibes here and don't want to spend my money here.  I told the waiter we didn't care for the way being treated.  He just said: okay. So we left. We will not return ever. There are so many other good places to eat.","We sincerely apologize for your recent experience, Sherprina. We aim for our guests to feel welcomed and appreciated from the moment they arrive.

I add side order of the smother turnip greens 8/10. My husband had the complete creole dinner, picked chicken andouille gumbo 10/10, creole combo platter 8/10 and cream spinach 6/10. The service was okay, I know our server was busy but we waited for a long time for the menu, taking the order, our drink, AND we didnt get our order at the same time.

"B&B Smokehouse is always a favorite spot of mine. The food has always been really good, and the service is very quick. I have been eating here for roughly 14 years now. 

On this visit I ordered the two-meat plate with sausage and brisket. What I really like is that they ask you how you want your brisket. This time I went with the ""in-between,"" which was lean with some marbling.

My sides were creamed corn and potato salad. The sides were very flavorful and freshly made.

The location has plenty of seating for a group. The price was about what you would pay for any BBQ around San Antonio. Overall, the experience was a good one, and the food made me want to take a to-go plate.

Definitely recommend trying at least once!","We're grateful to know you've been a fan of ours for 14 years, Kevin! It's rewarding to hear that you appreciate our fast service and quality food.

"Food - prime rib was tough. Ordered it medium rare and half of the slice was medium well and the other half was medium. Cheesy potatoes were just OK. Garlic cheese bread is very good.

"Welcoming environment, super pleasant and accommodating employees, FANTASTIC sandwiches. I went in just to check out the hype and felt like I had walked into a little shop in Italy. Lots of unique specialty Italian food all over the deli walls, like pasta, sauces and imported candy. The young woman who took my order was sweet and very patient with all of my questions, and me taking forever to order. I got the Lucca and copied another reviewers idea of adding the spicy roasted red pepper sauce and brown mustard. Also added Brie cheese. So delicious! Then I went and ordered another one because everything sounded so good. Got the Siena- as is. Maybe even better than the first sandwich but it’s close to a tie. Had some spumoni gelato while I waited, also really good. I was recommended this place by my Italian family in the area and from my experience, it lives up to all of the hype and awards. I would not leave Davis without stopping in at least once!","We're thrilled that your visit to our deli felt like a mini vacation to Italy!

"Absolutely awful experience I asked if I could come in with my dogs. They said yes. I sat far away from everyone in a restaurant that was quite empty. I ordered a salad and a steak. I gave my little dogs a bite of my steak and they lost it, asked me to leave immediately.. My dogs are more well behaved than any kids. Zero respect for all the staff that were unprofessional, rude and ungracious. Will never go back. They asked me leave immediately and pay without offering me a to go container.

"I really enjoy the smothered chicken from Dylan's  Restaurant. The mac & cheese is deliciously cheesy, though it's not an oven-baked style--more cheesy.

"When I first showed up to absolute ink I wasn't really greeted in the best way and the person who helped me just didn't seem like he wanted to be working at his job. When we went into the room to get my piercings done he initially brought in very short bars to pierce my snake bites with and then he said something about them being to short. I thought he was gonna come back with the right size but he came back with bars that didn't leave any room for my swelling. When he was about to pierce my snake bites he first marked the dots and asked me what placement I wanted, we looked at the dots and they looked great to me and then without him telling me anything after he cleaned my lip he just put the needle through, which was a little bit of a shock. my old piercer would let me know, anyways first one through and it was looking fine and then he started on the second, he pierced it without warning again but wasn't as surprised but still was shocked, then he handed me a mirror. Not to mention he left the needle in my lip for awhile before the piercing was even in, not very fast. First thing I saw was they weren't symmetrical and my second hole was made at an angle and was not straight it was hitting my bottom teeth . I was so upset I just wanted to leave. I left and I ended up taking the crooked one out to let heal and get pierced correctly. Then after a little my first lip piercing that I left in started swelling lots with no room to swell, the metal back was digging into the inside of my lip and caused me lots of pain. I thought I'll just put ice on it and try to get the swelling down but a few days later here I am and it's very inflamed with puss coming out? Yeah I'm very upset and WILL NOT COME BACK. The vibe was very unpleasant and I felt like they didn't want a paying customer. ZERO STARSS","We sincerely apologize for your experience, Shy.

"Saw that this place has some good reviews so I thought we'd check it out.

The place is in the old China Town plaza, the same place 99 Market Ranch and 888 Korean BBQ are at, on the second/upper level.

The ambiance is cute, makes you feel as if you stepped into another world.  Maybe it is quiet on the upper level, maybe it's the decoration or maybe it's both.  Either way, I think it is quite quaint.

We came for lunch on a Saturday, around 1pm-ish.  There was another party there (about 6-8 people) but they were wrapping up.  We were there till around 3pm-ish and noticed around 2-2:30pm or so, more people were coming in (about 3-4 diff parties of two's).  

The place is clean and so is the bathroom, which is important to me.  Been to do many Asian restaurants where the bathrooms are just terribly kept clean and/ir cluttered with diff supplies.  So glad i didn't see that here! 

The services were good, they were eager to take orders...Took us about the 3rd time of them asking if we were ready to order because the menu is extensive and they weren't giving us enough time to really scanned thru. Anyway, we finally ordered and tge food came quickly enough.

The grubs were as follows:
1. Radna with sea food: First time seeing oysters with this dish and the usual shrimp, octopus and may even had some pieces of fish.  It was good, I have this a thumbs up

2. Pad Thai with shrimp: This fish was too sweet for me.  But I think most restaurants make it just as sweet, so that's just ""normal"" here I guess.  The Pad Thais in Thailand aren't as sweet.  I supposed they just westernized it for the US pallets.

3. Mixed Veggies Stir Fry: This was okay, we ordered it cuz the people we were with wanted it.  It's rather expensive just for mixed veggies in my opinion ($21).  It comes with rice, FYI

4. Yellow Curry, medium heat:  Flavor is good, the heat was just a little kick as a medium.   This comes with rice, FYI. 

5. Tom Kha with Veggies:  This has quite a bit of coconut milk and the spices were mild.  Despite how it has more coconut milk, the soup wasn't thick/heavy.   It has good variations of veggies and mushrooms.  

Overall I think it was good but it wasn't exceptional to me to stand out comparing to what I have had with ither restaurants in terms of similar entrées.  But I do want to come back and try their meat skewers and other items.   I also like the cute vibe/ambiance and will come back here again.",,"It's great to hear that you enjoyed our restaurant's unique ambiance and cleanliness, Kacee.

Looking forward to your next visit.","Here is the <yelp> Review <Saw that this place has some good reviews so I thought wed check it out.

The place is in the old China Town plaza, the same place 99 Market Ranch and 888 Korean BBQ are at, on the second/upper level.

The ambiance is cute, makes you feel as if you stepped into another world.  Maybe it is quiet on the upper level, maybe its the decoration or maybe its both.  Either way, I think it is quite quaint.

We came for lunch on a Saturday, around 1pm-ish.  There was another party there (about 6-8 people) but they were wrapping up.  We were there till around 3pm-ish and noticed around 2-2:30pm or so, more people were coming in (about 3-4 diff parties of twos).  

The place is clean and so is the bathroom, which is important to me.  Been to do many Asian restaurants where the bathrooms are just terribly kept clean and/ir cluttered with diff supplies.  So glad i didnt see that here! 

The services were good, they were eager to take orders...Took us about the 3rd time of them asking if we were ready to order because the menu is extensive and they werent giving us enough time to really scanned thru. Anyway, we finally ordered and tge food came quickly enough.

The grubs were as follows:
1. Radna with sea food: First time seeing oysters with this dish and the usual shrimp, octopus and may even had some pieces of fish.  It was good, I have this a thumbs up

2. Pad Thai with shrimp: This fish was too sweet for me.  But I think most restaurants make it just as sweet, so thats just ""normal"" here I guess.  The Pad Thais in Thailand arent as sweet.  I supposed they just westernized it for the US pallets.

3. Mixed Veggies Stir Fry: This was okay, we ordered it cuz the people we were with wanted it.  Its rather expensive just for mixed veggies in my opinion ($21).  It comes with rice, FYI

"Ordered the French Onion soup which looked great visually but all I could taste was way too much thyme, no real beef stock or onion flavor due to the overload of thyme.

"I know the owner means well and wants the best     But he might want to rethink some staff     I went there and the only person that looked at me was Joshua
Explained to him that my back window wasn’t going up and down properly, and that my auto mechanic didn’t want to bother with it    I had the window motor replaced by Nissan on Rt9 and its still not working and it might need the main switch in the drivers door   So 1st Joshua stood there like an idiot and said,”we are a body shop you know”,   And i said well you fix doors, you fix motor windows etc why wouldn’t you be able to fix my problem

"Our family went here for a celebration dinner (Il Vincinos been a past favorite but has seemed different for the past couple years, so we've rarely come. A side note they have gluten free breads but they dont have a disignated gf cooking grill)
We decided to try it out again and ordered our usuals- Pollo E Pesto Paninis (one cauliflower gluten free and one regular bread) and a pepperoni pizza.
Not even 30 minutes after eating me and 2 of my daughters weren't feeling well in our stomachs.
By 10 pm we were all violently throwing up. This all lasted thru the night.

We called this morning right when they opened up to let the manager know. We hoped they would also give a refund for the two sandwiches that were eating by the sick family members. We were told they can't do that because it's sick season and they couldn't know if it was some other virus. He told us food poisoning doesn't hit for 72 hours. That  is completely untrue (it usually hits pretty quickly within a couple hours). He said they get lots of calls everyday and if they refunded everyone they wouldn't be a business.
Ed, one of the managers took my number so that the main manager Peter could call me back. Hopefully he will treat us like valued customers and take care of the cost of the sandwiches that made us sick. And for the good of the public hopefully they will figure out what food handling policies and standards aren't being followed.
With how they've handled things we wont be supporting this buisness again.","Jordan, we sincerely apologize for your recent experience at our restaurant.

"Got up this morning around 3am due to jet lag and decided to sign up for a shark diving experience.  Are we glad we did.  The tour last 2 hours and you go out about 3 miles from shore to a large shark cage.  We had 2 awesome guudes, Jax and Reece and we really enjoyed their great attitude, instruction, and both were so much fun to be around.  Once we got to the cage, we spent a lot of tume in the water which was warmer than the shoreline which we loved and there were so many sharks.  I am not kidding, everywhere you looked were sharks and some were over 10 feet.  We never felt unsafe and it was so much fun.  If you are on the fence about going or are a little scared - dont be, you will have so much fun.  What an amazing time and a great memory.  Thanks again, Reece and Jax.  You both rock!","We're glad to hear about your early morning adventure with us, Eun! It's wonderful to know that Jax and Reece made your shark diving experience fun and safe.

It would be a frequent place to eat even in a bigger town--food is very good, won't break the bank, and we're seated and served quickly.","We're delighted to know that you and your wife are regular visitors, Christopher!

"We had an oil tank that had been unused under our brick patio, for almost 50 years. We had to have it removed to be able to sell our house.  Everyone at JS Tank Romoval could not have been more helpful or professional.  They carefully dug out the tank, worked with the inspector to analyze the tank and the dirt that had been below the tank, and sent samples to the lab since the tank had a small hole in it.  The lab text was negative and the dirt was replaced along with gravel to bring the hole level so the bricks could be replaced. The patio looks as good as new.

When first walking in I was impressed by the decor and space inside. We were a large group of 8 with a reservation. I arrived a little later than the rest of the group. I was never asked to order a drink. I ordered the sushi dinner. At other establishments the meals usually come with soup and salad however here they have to be ordered separately which isn't a big deal however their prices don't reflect this. The food wasn't very good. The rolls weren't made very well and fell apart before I could even pick them up. The sushi rice also fell apart when I picked the individual pieces of sushi up. I assume both are because the rice wasn't properly prepared. The soy sauce tasted like it was water down and had very little flavor. The quality of the fish varied. Most of it was good however the tuna was very low quality and very stringy. The service was ok for the most part however after we were through with the meal the server didn't ask if we wanted to order dessert. Overall the restaurant was ok at best.,"We apologize for not meeting your expectations, Matthew. We aim for a superior dining experience, we regret falling short on this occasion.

"My friends and I were in town for a wedding and a handful of us stopped in here for a quick meal. Being from a city that doesn't have any bbq joints, we were on a mission to get at least one of our meals at a local place.

Railhead Smokehouse BBQ didn't disappoint! First off, Fried Okra omg not something I would ever order but at the suggestion of the staff we did and we're so glad we did. I don't even know what Okra is, but this dish was a good starter.

Most of us got the combo dinner so we could try out multiple meats. I ordered the brisket and the sausage and my only complaint was that I couldn't order a 3lb version of the menu item. Our group also shared the peach cobbler that was freaking big enough to serve all of us.

Kitchen seemed slightly backed up and that's why I had to rate that 4-stars. I'm not certain I'll ever find myself in this neighborhood again, but if i do I will definitely come back here.","Stephen, we're happy that our BBQ was a highlight during your visit.

"So. I have to admit that the food was good. The staff wasn't helpful at all and the worst thing was the cleanliness. The overall experience became a disaster pretty quickly - we changed seats twice to sit at a relatively cleaner table only to find the wet floor under our feet. The staff had to be requested again & again to send us our server. 

I don't know how to rate this - Had no complaints when it comes to food but everything else was extremely poor.","Hassan, while we're glad to hear you enjoyed the food, we're sorry to learn that the rest of your visit fell short of expectations.

"Found out I needed to leave town for a bit unexpectedly so I used these guys to flush my coolant and service my transmission to save the time of doing myself for this long trip. I don't do yelp reviews. I'm unsure I've ever done one. That's how bad this is. 

   First complaint wouldn't be worth the review but since I'm here I'll mention it. They had some elderly lady working the desk. I literally stood behind her for at least 5 minute. Closer to 10. She was Just staring out at the workers. I thought she was a customer too. Then she turns around and she's who works the desk. Then I watch her mess up every customers checkout process at least once (twice for a state trooper that was paying with a state card) and seemed to need help with every transaction. Since I never priced my work, I've no idea if I was properly charged. That's minor compared to the work. 

   I paid $230 or $240 or so to have my transmission serviced and my coolant flushed. After a couple of days I notice fluid on my pavement. It's transmission fluid. I still haven't had that looked at. That prompted me to check my coolant. Guess what? There wasn't anything in the overflow to check. So I had to crawl under the truck and drain some. Checks -10°F. About the same as the fluid that was in the truck when I took it in for service. Fluid put in worth a radiator swap in 2016. I already know that grease monkey will say that's impossible. The use 50/50 premix. It should be about -34. I keep a tester in the glove box of all the vehicles we own that have radiators. All three say it's about -10°. 

I can't say how they did it. I don't know the method of flushing radiators. It was no better than when I took it and I couldn't even test it. I can't say how low it is. I'll take it to another shop before my trip in a few days. It won't be grease monkey. My first time there. Definitely my last. Maybe we can figure out why the driveway has transmission fluid on it. Fluid is full. I checked that. At least they got that right. 

I'm unsure I've ever pulled the trigger on a Yelp review. I'm doing it tonight. Never trusting these people with a vehicle again. Wasted money. I'm having it all done again at another shop since I don't have time to do it myself. I can definitely do it myself. That's how I know how pathetic this is. How the coolant is just as bad as when I brought it in but low? I can't explain that. That seems like they started and didn't finish or something. I just know people should avoid them. Transmissions are too expensive to play games with. This one was rebuilt 75,000 miles before I had them service it and it cost what cars used to cost. I'll have it done again my a transmission shop.  I don't trust their work one bit. $240 lesson. Don't go to the quick people. I should've left when they weren't able to properly cash anyone out. Someone's grandma is running a computer for the first time. 

Stay away!!!! Do NOT go here!","Beaux, we’re sorry that your visit with us left you feeling so frustrated and disappointed.

"Ok, so I've been going to Mamma Gina for 12 years and almost always had a great experience, however last time we were there the waiter was the most inattentive person we've ever had there, I told my wife I will never sit at his station again. So last night I went in and had a seat at the bar, ordered a Happy hour Manhattan , I've had my share of Manhattans over the years and I'm not that picky but last night was the weakest Manhattan I've ever had, it was extremely watered down. I ordered it on the rocks and they charged me a dollar for ice, not a square or round cube just plain old ice! Hint to the establishment, hide this in the drink price because that makes me mad to know I paid for ice! They didn't charge me for ice in my ice water so why do it in the drink, I know other restaurants are pushing this too and they will get away with it as long as we let them. I will say the spaghetti Bolognese was very good as usual, but from now on, I will not order any mixed drinks from Mamma Gina.","We sincerely apologize for your recent experience, Steve.

Bought a car from Hyundai and was told I’d have oil change service through them for the first year. I have tried to make an appointment with them three times in the last eight months and nothing is ever available. I finally gave up on getting an appointment online and went in and they told me it would take FIVE HOURS!! for an oil change!! It baffles me how a serve that takes ten minutes would take five hours. The service plan they give you when you buy is a scam. Don’t buy from Hyundai and don’t go to them for service. Absolutely asinine.,"Kayla, we understand your frustration with the service delay and its subsequent inconvenience. We assure you that misleading our customers is never our intention.

Went on a Saturday night after a Longhorns game so it was pretty busy. We did make a reservation and they checked someone else in under our name. Luckily they had room. Our waiter was nice but wasn't around much and we probably waited about 15 minutes to get his attention at the end of the meal. Food was wonderful! We got the filet mignon and it was a nice cut and very tender. The sides are huge and one side is more than enough for 2 people to share. They were out of the pork chop that night and it was only a little more than an hour after they opened. We also used the valet service out front and it was quick and easy.,"We're pleased that you enjoyed our filet mignon and sizable side dishes, Belle. However, it's unfortunate that the confusion with your reservation and the service did not meet your expectations. We regret that we ran out of pork chop that evening.

We look forward to the opportunity to serve you better in the future.","We're pleased to learn you enjoyed our filet mignon and sizable side dishes, Belle H.

"This review is only for their Bubble Teas as an avid bubble tea drinker:

• I ordered a Thai Tea and it comes with Boba (~$6)
• It was very delicious, the boba was also very tasty.

HOWEVER
• the boba are the size of itty bitty green peas (flavorful but very very small)
• the design of the cup is not very great. The straw is not long enough to even reach the bottom of the cup, which is where all the boba is.
• I suggest to get a flat lid or the traditional plastic wrap at the top

For these reasons, I will not be getting bubble tea from here.","Kushal, we regret to hear our bubble tea did not meet your standards.

"This restaurant boasts a lovely patio right in the heart of Rice Village.  They offer a variety of menu options as well as wine & cocktails.  I ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade and it was perfect!  My girlfriends and I shared baked goat cheese dip appetizer served with toast strips and we all agreed it was delicious. I ordered a Bacon Jam Club Sandwich with homestyle crisps. While the  portion of sandwich ingredients were hefty, I, unfortunately, did not like the overall flavor.  The bacon jam was too sweet and the combination of flavors just didn’t work for me.  I figured it was my fault so brought it home and my guy loved it.
Our waiter Gustavo was very pleasant and attentive; however, our food was delayed unacceptably too long.  He told us the kitchen was running behind and we patiently waited over half to :45 mins.   My girlfriends each ordered salads and one ordered a pizza.  I’ve shared pictures of those items as well.   Overall, the restaurant is welcoming and has a charming vibe on a beautiful day outside.

"This taco place was made for a quick and cheap meal that you wouldn't have to spend more than 30 minutes on and only around $3-$4 per taco! Makes sense as this is exactly what the name suggests. The flavor of most of the tacos is lacking, especially tacos that come with fried avocado or fish but there are a couple of tacos that stand out, like the Texas Barbecue. We were surprised about the multitude of options for ordering, from barbecue quesadillas to fish tacos. To be honest we would recommend them to limit their options more and focus on developing each topic to their peak but that’s just our opinion. Depending on the taco you get the texture will be different, but on most occasions, they do a really good job of adding texture to their food unless it's fried avocado. Although the place didn't have a complete Mexican feel to it, they tried toning down the modernized look and vibe with music and decorations which we appreciated. However overall, most tacos didn't come out as good as we expected and couches were torn up, because of these reasons we wouldn’t come back here and wouldn’t recommend.",,"Ethan, thanks for your comprehensive feedback.

"We recently stopped by Burger District in Arlington for brunch, and it was fantastic! The interior is cozy and super clean, creating a welcoming and relaxing vibe that’s perfect for enjoying a meal.

For brunch, we had the Mexican omelet and Eggs Benedict both were flavorful and cooked just right. The Mimosa Flight added a refreshing touch that made brunch even more enjoyable!

We couldn’t resist trying a few items from the dinner menu, too. The Chili Cheeseburger was outstanding, juicy, perfectly seasoned, and incredibly satisfying. The onion rings were crispy and not too greasy, and the Raspberry Shake was creamy and absolutely delicious.

"We were fortunate to find 1/2 Plumbing, I called on Saturday (2 days before my knee replacement) and by Monday they were redoing the pipes at the house.  Paul and his team were nothing less than phenomenal.  Responsible, Reliable, Meticulous work ethics and the final product was amazing.  You would never know they were there.  They made sure to tidy up after themselves and communicated along the way. They started Monday and finished on Thursday, while accommodating my post surgical needs.  They are truly the exception, I would recommend them for your Plumbing needs 100 X's over.  In addition when the inspector was here he was impressed with their work.  They are the best, I would never use anyone else!

"Stopped in at 8:55 PM after a basketball game downtown for a quick bite and a drink with my daughter. Was greeted by a hostess who asked if we had a reservation and when I said no we were a walk-in she said oh I'm sorry the kitchen is closed.

She said well it's been a very busy day and everybody's very tired. Would not let us sit down and order a pizza and a salad at 8:55 PM on a Saturday night.

"If you are under 65 and/or have experienced decent dining I would warn you away. The pasta was soggy. My filet was so bad I didn't even eat a quarter of it (I was starving). We bought a bottle of wine which occupied most of our time, thankfully. We were completely ignored in terms of service while we watched the older clientele around us fawned over.. no one offered us fresh pepper even though I saw it offered to our neighbors (and I expressed interest in having some). Honestly after living in NY and LA I am spoiled for dining but this was worse than Olive Garden level for much more $. I hate leaving bad reviews but this was so bad.

"Great place if you like good food but don't give one about customer service. I went in with my dad the other day to eat after a funeral we had to attend and from the moment we got there this guy who's name I think is Eric, puts on this ""I don't care"" ""Italian guy"" act. While funny at first, it got annoying when he continued to interrupt my conversations with him. It felt like the whole time we were eating there he had some kind of comment to make. When I said I was the one paying I kept getting snarky remarks about my age. Card swipes, decline??? It was a perfectly good credit card and something was wrong with their system. I went elsewhere and my card was fine. My dad had to pay that bill which wasn't the intent and he makes remarks about how I planned it to not have to pay for my lunch I check my credit card today, the restaurant payment went through and we got double charged. Now I have to go through my bank to cancel this and go back to figure this all out. Food was delicious unfortunately but because of this I can't see myself ever coming back.","We sincerely apologize for your unsatisfactory experience, Ashley.

"We got meatballs and calamari for the appetizers. I loved the meatballs! the pomegranates with the sauce were soo good 10/10. We also got the New York steak with shrimp and the pollo firenze with side of truffle fries.  The steak was a bit chewy for my liking but next time we'll ask for medium well. For the dessert, we got the maklout. This was definitely something new we have yet tried before and I'm glad we chose that one. It came with rice noodles, vanilla ice cream, and cherry on top. It was the perfect dessert. The service was on top of it. We didnt wait long and the waitors made sure we were taken care with estimated food wait times.","Michelle, we're happy to know you enjoyed our meatballs and calamari appetizers and appreciated the complementary pomegranate sauce.

"Signs call this a bbq joint, and there is brisket and baby back ribs, and there's also a section of really big steak dinners (really big as in both the steaks and the amount of accompaniment they come with), but it was lunchtime so I ignored that.

I turned to the sandwich section, and found what they call the Plow Boy.  It's a soft French roll with a big pile of shaved brisket, pastrami, and bacon, mixed in with bits of onion rings and jalapenos (which give it what spiciness it's got), and some melted pepper jack cheese.  It was less exciting or exotic than that sounds, but it was pretty good and I'm not unhappy I came here.

"Amazing experience! This place provides affordable fresh seafood and the food is outstanding! Local must try! This place was packed and the service was the best in town! Food came out super fresh and hot! We ordered:

* fried shrimp and oysters with potatoes 5/5- fried shrimp was crispy and I love that it was lightly batter. Love that the batter was seasoned and let the shrimp shine as the star! Shrimp cooked to perfection and everything you want in a fried shrimp! It wasn't oily and was perfect! It looked not great but tasted superior! The oysters was juicy and batter was crispy and crunchy love it! Definitely will order this again! 
* seafood gumbo 5/5 - spicy level was on point and tasted like homemade gumbo from home! Delicious and highly recommended! Also you can ask the waiter for a sample of the gumbo! Our waiter brought a sample to us without us asking. He was so intuitive and wanted to make sure we liked it before ordering it and wasted gumbo. I love never experience this before and appreciate the zero food waste! Our waiter Lelan went above and beyond to make us feel so welcome and taken care of! He truly was so intuitive and went above and beyond for service. We appreciated his hospitality and would come back just for him. The food being delicious is a bonus! 
* peach cobbler pie--- 5/5! RUN and get this! Hands down one of the best homemade peach cobbler pie I've ever had! It was so good and I can't stop thinking about it! The crunchy crumbles, peaches, caramel, and cake was .... Life changing! It's served with vanilla ice cream with was oh my ... heaven in a bowl! If only I could get this FedEx to my home I would! 

Do I recommend this place? Absolutely MUST try! Local favorite and amazing food! I love that the owners open this restaurant with the intent to provide fresh seafood at an affordable price! You can taste the love in each plate! We can't wait to come back! The sangrias are good too!",,"Thank you for your glowing review, Scarlett! It seems you had quite the culinary adventure with us, savouring everything from fried shrimp and oysters to seafood gumbo and peach cobbler pie. We're delighted that our dishes hit the mark for you. We're particularly pleased that Lelan's excellent service made an impression, he's a true asset to our team. It's rewarding to know that the love we pour into our food is evident in every dish.

I was there at the end of October for my son's birthday. Was told about sticky buns so I went there and bought a half a dozen and brought them back to Chattanooga Tennessee. I took them out of the box and wrap them individually in wax paper and put them in the freezer. I take them out of the freezer let them thaw then put them in the microwave to heat them. They are absolutely delicious. I've never had anything like it before and I would recommend them to anyone who is in the Williamsport area to go by and try them if they haven't already. I will be making a order to have ship to me so that I have more on hand. I have already ran out of them. I'm hooked on them so that's the reason I need to order some to be shipped to me.,"We're happy to hear our sticky buns left a lasting impression, Tim!

"What a waste of money. Frankly Kingfish is better. Got a combo of fried shrimp and oysters with a side of red potatoes. There were 4 shrimp and 6 oysters about the size of a quarter. The shrimp were small, dry and very chewy like they weren't very fresh and cooked too long. There was a lot of batter to make them look bigger than they were.The oysters were very small, chewy and with a very strong flavor. The potatoes were served with a dish of melted butter with at least 1/2 inch of minced garlic in the bottom. My friend got the fried combo of shrimp and scallops. Hers were the same as mine. Dried up and chewy. What a disappointment. The tartar sauce was basically mayonnaise with a little pickle in it. The highlight of the meal was the complimentary piece of seafood bread. I left there hungry and will not return. We spent $40.","Sherry, we're sad to hear that your experience didn't meet your expectations.

We ordered the Happy Hour Duck Wontons and Veggie Gyoza, both were just fantastic. My toddler loved them too!

I ordered the Thaigerr Green Curry (mild), and while it had a nice kick to it, the flavors and quality of the meat and vegetables were so lovely.

My husband ordered the Drunken Noodles and couldn’t stop raving about the glass noodles themselves.

The Lemongrass hot tea was really smooth and neutral, and my husband thought the Japanese whiskey Old Fashioned was nice.

"As homeowners, we were initially hesitant about undertaking a major landscape project. We researched local firms, interviewed a few, and after communicating with Charles (Charles Hodges Ltd. Gardens), we knew we had found the right person and company. We emailed Charles our ""wish list"" of garden elements that included:

• low maintenance/perennials
• level grading
• 4-season flowers/garden
• focal point water feature (pond or waterfall)
• low voltage lighting
• natural-look seating area (stone)
• ornamental trees
• butterfly garden
• fire feature
• grilling area

After reviewing our wish list and at his first visit to our house, he told us about his vision for our yard and that he wanted to design an ""outdoor room"" that would essentially be an extension of our indoor space so that we could step out from one room in our house into another room. He truly accomplished this; his landscape design is stunning and nothing short of a masterpiece! Charles really listened to us and incorporated every one of our wish list elements into his plan. The result is that our garden reflects our style and enhances the overall value and appeal of our home. What is even more remarkable is that he incorporated all of these elements into a relatively small backyard land area!

Our project also involved his design of infrastructure including a natural stone seating area, pond with water fountain, low-voltage lighting, irrigation, and whole-house drainage system. Not only did Charles design our project, he and his turnkey team constructed it to the nth degree bringing every detail of his plan to life. Construction began with tearing out an existing concrete slab, then digging a hole for the pond. We both thought, what did we get ourselves into? Charles' turnkey construction process was seamless and his construction team was very professional, knowledgeable, courteous, and always willing to answer our questions. We were extremely impressed by their attention to detail and commitment to quality.

Also, Charles stands behind his commitments and delivered excellent results. The project was just about complete when we experienced a major rain storm. The drainage system did not accommodate the unexpected amount. We called Charles, sent a video, and that evening he called his crew and had them return to our house the very next day. They installed more drains for the system and reconstructed the garden at no additional cost! Since then, we have had another major rain storm, and the added drains worked perfectly. Customer service is his priority: whenever we have a question, we call Charles and he answers right away or gets back to us as soon as he is able.

Charles' landscape design is a testament to his artistic vision and deep understanding of horticultural principles. Our garden layout is visually appealing, practical, and incorporates a harmonious blend of native perennial plants that thrive in our local climate. His use of color, texture, height, and plant variety resulted in a truly captivating serene outdoor space. So much so, that we now call our new ""room"" Serenity Garden!

We highly recommend Charles and his entourage for any and all landscape projects!",,"We're delighted your experience with our services met your expectations. Your detailed feedback, which contributes to our commitment to excellence, is valued. It's gratifying to know we successfully realized your vision for your 'Serenity Garden' and you're enjoying it.

"I am extremely disappointed. I’ve never had Jessops and decided to try it for the first time about a week ago
. I ordered to-go, let me just say it’s been a nightmare.  mostly everything in the order was wrong, I was missing things and the things that I did have were cooked to a different temperature than I had asked and soggy sides. It was just a really bad first experience and so I called. I spoke to a manager named Josh and Josh was slightly apologetic and had offered a refund and we were quickly off the phone.
Fast forward to this week I still have not received a refund and I called yesterday to check in and see what was up, was very nice but obviously disappointed. I waited on hold for around 20 minutes all together the call hung up I called back and then the “manager” said she would give my information to a manager. Which confused me because I thought I was speaking to the manager. I’m not a raging b*tch and this is my first review on a restaurant. I’m just frustrated that I was told I would get a refund for my expensive meals that were made completely wrong and I still have yet to receive the refund or proof that I will even get a refund. I’m highly disappointed I really wanted to like this place. (I had ordered mashed potatoes, medium rare broil and fries, they gave me squash, fries, dry steak) (my boyfriend had gotten sweet potato fries with caramel sauce and they never gave him the caramel sauce. Not to mention there was a toothpick buried inside of the sandwich)","We sincerely apologize for your disappointing experience, Livy. We understand the error with your order and subsequent follow-up.

"We had an incredible experience with Stephanie Green as our realtor. From the moment we met her at an open house, Stephanie was warm, friendly, and genuinely interested in helping us achieve our goals. She took the time to listen to our needs without ever being pushy and immediately went into action, guiding us through the process of selling our home and finding our new one.

Stephanie’s knowledge of the real estate world is truly invaluable. She not only understands the market deeply but also uses her expertise to protect her clients’ best interests. For example, when we discussed selling our home, we were in the middle of a bathroom remodel and had planned to do more work. Stephanie reassured us we didn’t need to spend extra money on renovations. She provided thorough comps of similar homes in our area, showing us that our house would sell quickly and for more than we anticipated—and she was absolutely right! Stephanie saved us time, money, and stress with her experience and insight.

Selling and buying at the same time was challenging, but Stephanie made it a smooth and worthwhile process. She handled every detail, from negotiating with sellers to coordinating with builders and managing the mountains of paperwork. Her dedication and persistence were evident at every step. We couldn’t have done it without her and her team, including Courtney Resendiz, who was also fantastic.

What stands out most about Stephanie is her trustworthiness and commitment. She goes above and beyond, often working after hours and on weekends to ensure everything goes as smoothly as possible. She was there for us through every step, making sure we requested specific additions in our contract for the new home that we wouldn’t have known to ask for, like fencing, sod, and color choices.

If you’re hesitant about taking that next step in real estate, don’t hesitate with Stephanie. You won’t find a realtor who brings more value or dedication. She genuinely cares, listens, and acts swiftly to get you into the perfect home. We can’t recommend Stephanie highly enough. Throughout every roadblock and stressful moment, she was there, making us feel confident and supported. Stephanie is exactly who you want on your side—knowledgeable, trustworthy, dedicated, and persistent.","We're pleased about your positive experience with Stephanie, Esther. Her commitment to understanding and satisfying client needs is fundamental to us. We're happy that her knowledge and expertise in real estate greatly helped your buying and selling process.
